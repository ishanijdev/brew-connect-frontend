# ![alt text](logo2-1.png) Br√©w Connect - E-Commerce Frontend

This is the frontend for a complete full-stack e-commerce web application for a fictional coffee brand. It features a modern, responsive user interface and connects to a custom-built backend API to manage products, users, and orders.

**Live Demo:** [https://coffee-leaf-frontend.vercel.app/](https://coffee-leaf-frontend.vercel.app/)

## Features

* **Dynamic Product Catalog:** The menu page fetches and displays all coffee products directly from the backend API.
* **User Authentication:** Fully-featured user registration and login system. The navbar dynamically updates based on login status.
* **Persistent Shopping Cart:** A logged-in user's cart is saved to their database account and persists across devices.
* **Guest Cart:** Non-logged-in users can still shop using a cart stored in local storage.
* **Simulated Payment Flow:** A complete checkout process with options for **Card** and **Cash on Delivery** that simulates a real transaction.
* **Order History:** A dedicated profile page where logged-in users can view all their past orders.
* **Unique Mood Recommender:** A custom page that calls a special API endpoint to filter and suggest coffees based on user-selected moods.
* **Responsive Design:** The layout is fully responsive and works beautifully on devices of all sizes.
